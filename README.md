Some description : 
•	Developed a predictive model to forecast stock prices, enhancing investment decision-making through data-driven insights.
•	Implemented LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks to capture complex patterns and dependencies in sequential stock price data also utilized ARIMA and XGBOOST models.
•	Utilized the Streamlit open-source library to create an interactive web application for visualizing stock predictions and model performance.
•	For data visualization I used libraries like Matplotlib – plotly to present results clearly and effectively, enhancing user experience and comprehension.
